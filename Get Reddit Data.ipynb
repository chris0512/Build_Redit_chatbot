      "I suspect for much of Apple’s life, the vast majority of Apple employees owned a piece of the company. I don’t know if Apple Store employees do - they may not - but Apple stores are a comparatively recent addition and I bet the engineering staff through the 90s were employee-owners as that’s the norm in Silicon Valley. At some point Apple made a decision to contract out manufacturing, so the people actually building Apple computers and phones are mostly not Apple employees and not owners. And it was certainly a significant decision to bring on venture capital investors (and later public shareholders) who were not employees of the company (though I think history would show pretty clearly that if they hadn’t done that we wouldn’t have Apple today). \n",
      "\n",
      "But I do think it’s worth noting that all of these *decisions* were, at Apple, mostly made by the early employees \/ founders, not by third party shareholders. That’s idiosyncratic to tech, an industry dominated by strong founders, but it’s true at Apple, at Google, at Facebook, at Amazon, etc - the decision makers are the founding employees. In fact at many of these companies the founders have put in place systems such that “capitalist” public owners explicitly DON’T have control of the business, only the founders do, long after the founder ownership levels have decreased.\n",

      "Even Goldman Sachs was a “partnership” for most of its history - ENTIRELY owned by a subset of its employee population. This is true for every major large corporate law firm today. Just because these businesses are “employee owned” clearly doesn’t mean they’re run “for the benefit of the people” - they’re run by rich early employees who want to get richer (and maybe have other motivations, like building great products, or personal celebrity, or whatever). \n",
